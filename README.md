## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Vision Walk Description

Three components of Vision Walk are:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Usage

The system is in experimental stage and can infer incorrect results. Please test the system in safe environments.

Launch the system and it will automatically capture the surrounding environments. Test across various scenarios and raise a new issues incase you encounter any issues or have improvements suggestion.

** Add system demo images _For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_**

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/shashank6341/Vision Walk HCI/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

** Create a new branch for each new feature or a sub-feature for easy debugging. **

- feature/{feature-name}
- Once tested and working as expected.
- Create a PR from feature to main.
